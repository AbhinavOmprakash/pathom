The number of history steps to keep in memory.\n     :normalize    - whether the state should be normalized.

Defaults to [:remote]\n     :hydrate?     - Bolean. When true, it indicates the the first render should assume the server pre-rendered a DOM,\n                     which will cause a call to hydrate instead of render (React 16+).\n     :root-render  - the root render function. Defaults to ReactDOM.render\n     :root-hydrate - the root hydrate function. Defaults to ReactDOM.hydrate. Only used on initial render, and only if `:hydrate?` is true.\n     :root-unmount - the root unmount function. Defaults to\n                     ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode\n     :render-mode  - :normal - fastest, and the default. Components with idents can refresh in isolation.\n                               shouldComponentUpdate returns false if state/data are unchanged. Follow-on reads are\n                               required to refresh non-local concerns.\n                     :keyframe - Every data change runs a root-level query and re-renders from root.\n                                 shouldComponentUpdate is the same as :default.

Not really useful for anything but benchmarking.\n     :lifecycle    - A function (fn [component event]) that is called when react components either :mount or :unmount. Useful for debugging tools.\n     :tx-listen    - a function of 2 arguments that will listen to transactions.\n                     The first argument is the parser's env map also containing\n                     the old and new state. The second argument is a history-step (see history).
