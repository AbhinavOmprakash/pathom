During\n  operation it also adds (by default) fetch markers into the app state so you can show busy indicators on the UI\n  components that are waiting for data. The `:target` parameter can be used to place the data somewhere besides app\n  state root (which is the default).\n\n  The server will receive a query of the form: [({server-property (prim/get-query class-or-factory)} params)], which\n  a Fulcro parser will correctly parse as a join on server-property with the given subquery and params. See the AST and\n  instructions on parsing queries in the developer's guide.\n\n  Parameters:\n  - `app-or-comp-or-reconciler` : A component instance, Fulcro application, or reconciler\n  - `server-property-or-ident` : A keyword or ident that represents the root of the query to send to the server. If this is an ident\n  you are loading a specific entity from the database into a local app db table. A custom target will be ignored.\n  - `class-or-factory` : A component that implements IQuery, or a factory for it (if using dynamic queries). This will be combined with `server-property` into a join for the server query. Needed to normalize results.\n    class-or-factory can be nil, in which case the resulting server query will not be a join.\n  - `config` : A map of load configuration parameters.\n\n  Config (all optional):\n  - `target` - An assoc-in path at which to put the result of the Subquery (as an edge (normalized) or value (not normalized)).\n    Can also be special targets (multiple-targets, append-to,\n    prepend-to, or replace-at). If you are loading by keyword (into root), then this relocates the result (ident or value) after load.\n    When loading an entity (by ident), then this option will place additional idents at the target path(s) that point to that entity.\n  - `initialize` - Optional. If `true`, uses `get-initial-state` on class-or-factory to  get a basis for merge of the result. This allows you\n    to use initial state to pre-populate loads with things like UI concerns. If `:initialize` is passed a map, then it uses that as\n    the base target merge value for class-or-factory instead.\n  - `remote` - Optional. Keyword name of the remote that this load should come from.\n  - `params` - Optional parameters to add to the generated query\n  - `marker` - ID of marker. Normalizes a load marker into app state so you can see progress.\n  - `refresh` - A vector of keywords that will cause component re-renders after the final load/mutations. Same as follow-on\n  reads in normal `transact!`\n  - `parallel` - If true, indicates that this load does not have to go through the sequential network queue. Defaults to false.\n  - `post-mutation` - A mutation (symbol) to run after the data is merged. Note, if target is supplied be sure your post mutation\n  should expect the data at the targeted location. The `env` of that mutation will be the env of the load (if available), but will also include `:load-request`.\n  - `post-mutation-params` - An optional map  that will be passed to the post-mutation when it is called. May only contain raw data, not code!\n  - `fallback` - A mutation (symbol) to run if there is a server/network error. The `env` of the fallback will be the env of the load (if available), but will also include `:load-request`.\n  - `update-query` - A optional function that can transform the component query before sending to remote.\n      For example, to focus a subquery using update-query:\n          {:update-query #(prim/focus-subquery % [:my {:sub [:query]}])}\n\n      Removing properties (like previous :without option):\n          {:update-query #(df/elide-query-nodes % #{:my :elisions})}\n  - `focus` - An optional subquery to focus on some parts of the original query.\n  - `without` - An optional set of keywords that should (recursively) be removed from the query.\n  - `abort-id` - An ID (typically a keyword) that you can use to cancel the load via `fulcro.client/abort`.\n\n  Notes on UI Refresh:\n  The refresh list will automatically include what you load (as a non-duplicate):\n  - When target is set and has 2+ elements: refresh will include an ident of the first two elements\n     - e.g. `:target [:a 1 :thing]` -> `:refresh [[:a 1]]`\n  - When target has a single element, refresh will include that element as a keyword\n     - e.g. `:target [:thing]` -> `:refresh [:thing]`\n  - When there is no target:\n     - If prop-or-ident is a kw -> `:refresh [kw]`\n     - If prop-or-ident is an ident -> `:refresh [ident]`\n  In all cases, any explicit refresh things you include will not be dropped. The computed refresh list\n  is essentially a `(-> original-refresh-list set add-computed-bits vec)`.\n  \"\n  ([app-or-comp-or-reconciler server-property-or-ident class-or-factory] (load app-or-comp-or-reconciler server-property-or-ident class-or-factory {}))\n  ([app-or-comp-or-reconciler server-property-or-ident class-or-factory config]\n   {:pre [(or (prim/component? app-or-comp-or-reconciler)\n            (prim/reconciler? app-or-comp-or-reconciler)\n            #?(:cljs (implements? fc/FulcroApplication app-or-comp-or-reconciler)\n               :clj  (satisfies? fc/FulcroApplication app-or-comp-or-reconciler)))]}\n   (let [component-or-reconciler (if #?(:cljs (implements? fc/FulcroApplication app-or-comp-or-reconciler)\n                                        :clj  (satisfies? fc/FulcroApplication app-or-comp-or-reconciler))\n                                   (get app-or-comp-or-reconciler :reconciler)\n                                   app-or-comp-or-reconciler)\n         reconciler              (prim/any->reconciler component-or-reconciler)\n         {:keys [load-marker-default query-transform-default]} (-> reconciler :config)\n         config                  (merge\n                                   (cond-> {:marker load-marker-default :parallel false :refresh [] :without #{}}\n                                     query-transform-default (assoc :update-query query-transform-default))\n                                   config)\n         state                   (prim/app-state reconciler)\n         mutation-args           (load-params* @state server-property-or-ident class-or-factory config)]\n     (prim/transact! component-or-reconciler (load-mutation mutation-args)))))\n\n#?(:cljs\n   (defn load-action\n     \"\n     See `load` for descriptions of parameters and config.\n\n     Queue up a remote load from within an already-running mutation.
