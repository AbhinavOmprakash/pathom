When an app starts, the debug tool can have several hooks that are notified:\n\n  ::tool-id some identifier to place the tool into the tool map\n  ::tx-listen is a (fn [tx info] ...) that will be called on every `transact!` of the app. Return value is ignored.\n  ::network-wrapper is (fn [network-map] network-map') that will be given the networking config BEFORE it is initialized. You can wrap\n  them, but you MUST return a compatible map out or you'll disable networking.\n  ::component-lifecycle is (fn [component evt]) that is called with evt of :mounted and :unmounted to tell you when the given component mounts/unmounts.\n  ::instrument-wrapper is a (fn [instrument] instrument') that allows you to wrap your own instrumentation (for rendering) around any existing (which may be nil)\n  ::app-started (fn [app] ...) that will be called once the app is mounted, just like started-callback/client-did-mount. Return value is ignored.\"\n  [{:keys [::tool-id] :as tool-registry}]\n  (swap! fulcro-tools assoc tool-id tool-registry))\n\n(defn- normalize-network [networking]\n  #?(:cljs (if (or\n                 (implements? net/FulcroRemoteI networking)\n                 (implements? net/FulcroNetwork networking)) {:remote networking} networking)\n     :clj  {}))\n\n(defn- add-tools [original-start original-net original-tx-listen original-instrument]\n  (let [net     (normalize-network original-net)\n        listen  (or original-tx-listen (constantly nil))\n        started (or original-start (constantly nil))]\n    (reduce\n      (fn [[start net listen instrument lifecycle] {:keys [::tool-id ::tx-listen ::network-wrapper ::app-started ::instrument-wrapper ::component-lifecycle]}]\n        (let [start      (if app-started (fn [app] (app-started app) (start app)) start)\n              net        (if network-wrapper (network-wrapper net) net)\n              listen     (if tx-listen (fn [env info] (tx-listen env info)) listen)\n              instrument (if instrument-wrapper (instrument-wrapper instrument) instrument)\n              lifecycle  (if component-lifecycle (fn [c e] (component-lifecycle c e) (when lifecycle (lifecycle c e))) lifecycle)]\n          [start net listen instrument lifecycle]))\n      [started net listen nil nil]\n      (vals @fulcro-tools))))\n\n; easier to access, so the user don't have to require a impl namespace to reference\n(def mutate app/write-entry-point)\n\n\n(defn make-fulcro-client\n  \"Entry point for creating a new fulcro client.

If you do not supply a networking object, one will be provided that connects to the\n  same server the application was served from, at `/api`.\n\n  `:request-transform` DEPRECATED. ONLY WORKS WITH DEFAULT REMOTE. Use a custom remote with client middleware instead.\n  If supplied it must be a function:\n\n  ```\n (fn [{:keys [body headers]}] {:body body' :headers headers'})\n  ```\n\n  it can replace the outgoing EDN of body or headers (returning both as a vector). NOTE: Both of these are clojurescript types.\n  The edn will be encoded with transit, and the headers will be converted to a js map. IMPORTANT: Only supported\n  when using the default built-in single-remote networking.\n\n  `:initial-state` is your applications initial state. If it is an atom, it *must* be normalized. Fulcro databases\n  always have normalization turned on (for server data merging). If it is not an atom, it will be auto-normalized.\n\n  `:client-did-mount` is an optional function that will receive the intialized fulcro application after it is\n  mounted in the DOM, and is useful for triggering initial loads, routing mutations, etc. The reconciler is available\n  under the `:reconciler` key (and you can access the app state, root node, etc from there.). The legacy name of\n  this option (:started-callback) is still supported, but is deprecated.\n\n  `:network-error-callback`. DEPRECATED. Use a custom remote with middleware instead.\n  This is a function of three arguments, the app state atom, status code, and the error, which will be invoked for\n  every network error (status code >= 400, or no network found). Only works if you choose to use the default built-in\n  networking (ignored if you specify :networking).\n\n  `:transit-handlers` (optional). DEPRECATED: Use a custom client network with middleware instead.\n\n  `:shared` (optional). A map of arbitrary values to be shared across all components, accessible to them via (prim/shared this)\n\n  `:load-marker-default` (optional) A default value to use for the `:marker` option of loads (default is false which means\n  no markers).\n\n  `:query-transform-default` (optional) A (fn [query] query) that is used as the default `:update-query` for data-detch/load parameters.\n  This can be used to customize things like preventing certain keywords from ever appearing in the remote version of a\n  component's query. See `fulcro.client.elide-query-nodes` for an idea of a common helper.\n\n  `:read-local` (optional). DEPRECATED. DO NOT USE.\n\n  `:query-interpreter` (optional). A custom query engine (parser and interpreter) that will be used to satisfy all\n  local client queries from the local state database. Cannot be used with `:read-local`.\n  It must be a `(fn [env query] )` that returns the result for the given query. It will not be given mutations.\n  The `env` will contain the `:state` atom, `:shared`, and `:parser`. It may also contain the `:reconciler`.\n\n  `:networking` (optional). An instance of FulcroNetwork that will act as the default remote (named :remote). If\n  you want to support multiple remotes, then this should be a map whose keys are the keyword names of the remotes\n  and whose values are FulcroNetwork instances.\n\n  `:mutation-merge (optional). DEPRECATED. Use mutation joins or network middleware instead.\n\n  `:reconciler-options (optional). A map that will be merged into the reconciler options.
