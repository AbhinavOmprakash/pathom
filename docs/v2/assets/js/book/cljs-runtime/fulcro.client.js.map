NOTE: Both of these are clojurescript types.\n  The edn will be encoded with transit, and the headers will be converted to a js map. IMPORTANT: Only supported\n  when using the default built-in single-remote networking.\n\n  `:initial-state` is your applications initial state. If it is an atom, it *must* be normalized. Fulcro databases\n  always have normalization turned on (for server data merging). If it is not an atom, it will be auto-normalized.\n\n  `:client-did-mount` is an optional function that will receive the intialized fulcro application after it is\n  mounted in the DOM, and is useful for triggering initial loads, routing mutations, etc. The reconciler is available\n  under the `:reconciler` key (and you can access the app state, root node, etc from there.). The legacy name of\n  this option (:started-callback) is still supported, but is deprecated.\n\n  `:network-error-callback`. DEPRECATED. Use a custom remote with middleware instead.\n  This is a function of three arguments, the app state atom, status code, and the error, which will be invoked for\n  every network error (status code >= 400, or no network found). Only works if you choose to use the default built-in\n  networking (ignored if you specify :networking).\n\n  `:transit-handlers` (optional). DEPRECATED: Use a custom client network with middleware instead.\n\n  `:shared` (optional). A map of arbitrary values to be shared across all components, accessible to them via (prim/shared this)\n\n  `:load-marker-default` (optional) A default value to use for the `:marker` option of loads (default is false which means\n  no markers).\n\n  `:query-transform-default` (optional) A (fn [query] query) that is used as the default `:update-query` for data-detch/load parameters.\n  This can be used to customize things like preventing certain keywords from ever appearing in the remote version of a\n  component's query. See `fulcro.client.elide-query-nodes` for an idea of a common helper.\n\n  `:read-local` (optional). DEPRECATED. DO NOT USE.\n\n  `:query-interpreter` (optional). A custom query engine (parser and interpreter) that will be used to satisfy all\n  local client queries from the local state database. Cannot be used with `:read-local`.\n  It must be a `(fn [env query] )` that returns the result for the given query. It will not be given mutations.\n  The `env` will contain the `:state` atom, `:shared`, and `:parser`. It may also contain the `:reconciler`.\n\n  `:networking` (optional). An instance of FulcroNetwork that will act as the default remote (named :remote).
