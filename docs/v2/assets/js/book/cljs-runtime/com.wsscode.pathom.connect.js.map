This function is intended to help dynamic\n  resolvers that need to know which attributes are required before doing a call to the\n  information source. For example, we never want to issue more than one GraphQL query\n  to the same server at the same query level, but if we just look at the parent query\n  is not enough; that's because some of the attributes might require other attributes\n  to be fetched, this function will scan the attributes and figure everything that is\n  required so you can issue a single request.\n\n  Please note the attribute calculation might depend on the data currently available\n  in the `::p/entity`, if you are calculating attributes for a different context\n  you might want to replace some of the entity data.\n\n  This function is intended to be called during resolver code.\"\n  [env query]\n  (let [children (->> query (p/lift-placeholders env) p/query->ast :children)]\n    (->> (reduce\n           (fn [{:keys [provided] :as acc} {:keys [key]}]\n             (if (contains? provided key)\n               (update acc :items conj key)\n               (if-let [plan (first (resolve-plan (assoc-in env [:ast :key] key)))]\n                 (-> acc\n                     (update :items into (or (some->> plan first second (resolver-data env) ::input)))\n                     (update :items into (map first) plan)\n                     (update :provided into (plan->provides env plan)))\n                 (update acc :items conj key))))\n           {:items    #{}\n            :provided #{}}\n           children)\n         :items)))\n\n(defn project-parent-query-attributes\n  \"Project query attributes for the parent query.
