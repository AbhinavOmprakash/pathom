Should requests to this remote be queued sequentially (false means they will hit the network\n  as submitted, true means the prior one has to complete (by default) before the next starts).  Loads can be made parallel\n  with a load option, so you should typically not override this option.\n\n  A result with a 200 status code will result in a merge using the resulting response's `:transaction` as the query,\n  and the `:body` as the EDN to merge. If the status code is anything else then the details of the response will be\n  used when triggering the built-in error handling (e.g. fallbacks, global error handler, etc.).\"\n  [{:keys [url request-middleware response-middleware serial?] :or {url                 \"/api\"\n                                                                    response-middleware (wrap-fulcro-response)\n                                                                    request-middleware  (wrap-fulcro-request)} :as options}]\n  (map->FulcroHTTPRemote (merge options {:request-middleware  request-middleware\n                                         :response-middleware response-middleware\n                                         :url                 url\n                                         :serial?
