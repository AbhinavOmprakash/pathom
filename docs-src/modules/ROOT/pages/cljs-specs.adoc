= Removing specs on Clojurescript

If you are not using the specs provided by Pathom you can free some build space by
eliding then. To do that you need to set the Clojurescript compiler options with:

[source,clojure]
----
{:closure-defines
  {com.wsscode.pathom.misc.INCLUDE_SPECS false
   ; if you also want to remove from EQL
   ; edn-query-language.core.INCLUDE_SPECS false
   }}
