= Pathom Connect

`Connect` provides is a high-level abstraction layer for building query processing code. It handles a number of the gory
details in an automatic way that allows you to focus more on your data model and less on the parser itself.  It generates
an an index of your graph's features that can be used for a number of very useful features:

* Auto-complete of graph queries in tools for data exploration (see https://github.com/wilkerlucio/pathom-viz[Pathom Viz]).
* Graph edge generation from the index's connection information.
* Multiple ways to reach a given attribute, automatically resolved via known reachable edges and transitive relations.
