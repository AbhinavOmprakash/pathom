= Using a thread pool for parallel resolvers

When you run Pathom in Clojure with the parallel-connect, the resolver functions are
running inside core.async `go` blocks. However, in case of CLJS most IO is async, making
this a non-issue, but if you are in the Java environment and doing blocking IO, this means
the code is doing IO on `go` blocks, which is a No-No.

If you can switch to some library that does async IO that's the best option, but if you
can't or won't as of now, Pathom provides a thread pool helper so you can tell the engine to
run the resolvers there to avoid blocking the `go` blocks.

Here is an example of how to setup a thread pool (clj only!):

                  ; setup the thread pool
                  ::pc/thread-pool         (pc/create-thread-pool (async/chan 200))
                  ::p/placeholder-prefixes #{">"}}
