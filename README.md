# pathom [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/fulcrologic/fulcro/tree/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/wilkerlucio/pathom/tree/master) 

A Clojure library designed to provide a collection of helper functions to support Clojure(script) graph parsers using
om.next graph syntax.

For an introduction on `om.next` parser development [please check my article on the subject](https://medium.com/@wilkerlucio/implementing-custom-om-next-parsers-f20ca6db1664).
This library encapsulates the ideas presented there, and go deeper on parser patterns. And all documentation here assumes you understand the Om.next query syntax.
